//Summary of the application

This is a Library program which is run through a menu.
The user has the option between 5 options which are: 

1. Add a Book to the Library.
2. Loan a Book from the Library.
3. Search for a Book in the Library.
2. Add a Member to the Library.
5. Add a Staff to the Library.

The menu only runs 5 times before ending.


If I had more time I would add a gui to the program to make it more interactive, also I would some advanced error checking features to the program.
