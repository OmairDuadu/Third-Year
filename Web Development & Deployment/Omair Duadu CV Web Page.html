            <h2>Cover Letter</h2>
            <a>I found your posting on Monster for a network administrator and knew I wanted 
                to apply immediately. ABC Corporationâ€™s reputation for responsive service and
                 proactive support<br> differentiates your company from the rest, and I would
                like to be part of your dynamic team.

                Since graduating from XYZ College with a BS in computer science, I have worked 
                for three years as a network administrator for DEF Company.<br> In this role, 
                I am valued as a solutions-focused manager of networks, IT systems, user support 
                functions and technology projects. </a>
